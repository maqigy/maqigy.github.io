MrMcSuToday at 11:23
where'd you get the dns from
Homework BoiToday at 11:24
It’s sub domain
GoliaVictorToday at 11:24
just use the word ip because if viraj's ip changes he can just change where the link redirects to
Homework BoiToday at 11:24
No
MrMcSuToday at 11:24
where'd you get it from though
GoliaVictorToday at 11:24
netlify

Homework BoiToday at 11:25
No-Ip trusted by tp link cause they have settings for it
No
Netlify is my webhost
MrMcSuToday at 11:25
